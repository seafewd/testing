We derived the statement coverage tests by looking at each statement in the method

For example, the list for the statements in the method insert we defined in the following way

 * Statement 1: 'the for loop'
 * Statement 2: 'if (a.get(i) > x)'
 * Statement 3: 'a.add(i, x)'
 * Statement 4: 'if (a.get(i) == x)'
 * Statement 5: 'a.add(x)'

We made sure each to insert and check/assert in such a way that we could in effect guarantee
that each statement/node was executed. Exactly why we made the decisions we did can be found
in the comments.

These tests also covered all the branches, which in this case were

 * Branch 1: through the for loop
 * Branch 2: not though the for loop (last statement 'a.add(x)')
 * Branch 2: through 'if (a.get(i) > x)'
 * Branch 3: through 'if (a.get(i) == x)'
