We derived the statement coverage tests by looking at each statement in the method

For example, the list for the statements in the method insert we defined in the following way

 * Statement 1: the for loop
 * Statement 2: if (a.get(i) > x)
 * Statement 3: a.add(i, x);
 * Statement 4: if (a.get(i) == x)
 * Statement 5: a.add(x);

We made sure each to insert and check/assert in such a way that we could in effect guarantee
that each statement/node was executed. Exactly why we made the decisions we did can be found
in the comments.
